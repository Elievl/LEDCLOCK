# LEDCLOCK
Here's my python code to run a Raspberry Pi word clock, build off of LED strips
It uses the rpi_ws281x repository as a basis

Is using a raspberry pi overkill? 
YES.
I have micropython code if you want to run it on raspberry PICO.

Will I like it?
YES.

Are you running more than just this on your PI?
YES.

So download it if you want.
Some specs:
- using GPIO pin 18
- using 121 leds
- 


WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?
More animations
Code optimization
Thinking to add a button to trigger specific effects...
